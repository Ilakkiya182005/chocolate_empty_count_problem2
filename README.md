A toy factory is packing toys into boxes. Each box can contain either a toy (represented by an integer value) or be empty (represented by 0). Write a function to move all empty boxes to the end of the array while maintaining the order of the toys, and also return the count of empty boxes.


Sample Input :

 Boxes = [1,0,3,4,5,9,0,7,0]

 Output :

count 3
[1,3,4,5,9,7,0,0,0]
